  <h1 class="post-title">Why software?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2016</span>
  <p>I’ve put in over 600 hours since I started to learn how to code back in November when I got accepted into Flatiron School. I have to say that after I put in that amount of time I still feel like I am just scratching the surface. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, as things that are generally worth achieving almost always seem to have a steep learning curve. Pro athletes, pilots, musicians, physicians and actors all have one thing in common – they practice. Then they practice more. And more. And more. Until one day they find that the skill they are practicing on a consistent basis becomes a habit, which then becomes valuable enough to the world that people are willing to pay them lots of money. They become a professional.</p>

<p>So… why software? It’s the money… right? Software engineers make an above average living working in such a high demand field. If this was about the money I would have quit a long time ago. Flatiron School’s online curriculum is self-paced, which means the only person that will motivate you to keep pushing through those late nights coming home after work - staring into the abyss of failing tests - is yourself.</p>

<p>I’m willing to bet most people who were at the mastery level of their game aren’t going to look back at their life and say “I made $X amount of dollars during that year!” when asked the question “What did you enjoy most about your career?”</p>

<p>I’m not saying that setting goals for yourself to earn a great living is a bad thing. What I am saying is this: the process of mastering a craft itself is something that money can’t buy.</p>
