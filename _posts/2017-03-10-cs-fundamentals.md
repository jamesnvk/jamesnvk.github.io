title: CS Fundamentals Reflection
---

I wanted to write a short blog post reflecting on the knowledge I've gained by working through an <a href="https://github.com/jamesnvk/algorithms-and-data-structures" target="_blank">algorithms and data structures workshop</a>. I don't have a traditional CS degree, so I'm currently drinking the firehose of CS fundamentals - learning four semesters worth of material in a few months time is challenging but extremely rewarding.

Mastering a craft isn't easy, and I realized that in order to be a well rounded software engineer I need to obtain a solid foundation on the basics of algorithms and data structures. Flatiron School taught me how to learn and program *effectively*, so now I'm in the process of acquiring the skills to solve problems *both* *efficiently* and effectively. 

I've also learned that understanding how to approach a problem is an underrated skill as well. Problems always have two specific parts: a set of allowed inputs and the required properties of its output. I learned that having this model, then walking through the problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts, is a great way to approach most problems.

I'm very grateful to have learned two different programming paradigms early on in my career. Understanding the ins-and-outs of an object oriented programming language with Ruby, then moving to a functional language like JavaScript has really opened my eyes to the vast amounts of different patterns and approaches people can take whether its solving a simple problem or building a production level application at scale.

Since graduating, my thirst for learning and growth hasn't stopped. I think it has actually increased. I know I chose the right path, because its starting to feel like the beginning of a long and exciting career.
